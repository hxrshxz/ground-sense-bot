# 🚀 One-Click Deployment Guide

## Automatic Deployment Setup

### Option 1: Super Easy Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repo
   - Vercel automatically detects it's a Vite project!

3. **Set Environment Variable**:

   - In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy" - that's it! 🎉

### Option 2: Using Our Scripts

```bash
# Setup and build everything
npm run deploy:setup

# If you have Vercel CLI installed
npm run deploy:vercel
```
